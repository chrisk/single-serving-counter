## Single Serving Counter!

A quick [single-serving site](http://kottke.org/08/02/single-serving-sites)
that uses Javascript to count up the days, hours, and minutes since a hard-coded
date. Just add domain!

Includes a nice `capistrano` recipe to quickly configure an Apache virtual
host and deploy from your fork on GitHub.
